This game allows two teams to face off using characters with various stats and special abilities. The combat is turn-based, and each character can regenerate energy, attack, heal, or apply effects to allies or enemies.

Game Features
Turn-based system:
Each team takes turns performing actions.

Energy and Skills:
Characters use energy to perform skills. They can regenerate energy during their turn.

Status Effects:
Effects such as healing, damage, or temporary stat boosts can be applied to characters.

A character can attempt to dodge an attack if enough energy is available.

Core Functionalities
Energy Regeneration:
Characters regain energy based on their speed and the total number of characters on the field. Energy is capped at a maximum value (MAX_ENERGY).

Skills and Actions:
Each character has several skills, each with an energy cost. During their turn, a character can choose a skill to attack an enemy or heal an ally. The action may fail if the enemy dodges or if the character lacks sufficient energy.

Dodging:
Characters have a chance to dodge an attack based on their energy and stats. If a character successfully dodges, they avoid the attack entirely.

Status Effects:
Characters can apply status effects to themselves or their opponents, such as stat boosts or damage over time effects.

Turn-Based Combat:
The game is played over multiple turns. In each turn, characters choose actions and effects are applied. Characters with the most energy act first.
